# Notes

### Refund method
I have chosen to go with the withdraw pattern, cause a gigantic loop, with a timer based setup is just to much complexity to evne care for. Then one can rather create some kind of emailing, notficiations system around the fund, so that you are kindly reminded to go refund your contract.

### Payout/payoutTo
Iv added a payout / payoutTo method to be able to payout to a different address than the owner address.

### Fund method
Could consider a Staging pattern here!!!!
